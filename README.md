# real-time-nv-charge-control
A conceptual example of the Verilog code used to run our real-time initialization of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy's charge state.
This code is meant to provide an example of how one can build an FPGA capable of implementing some logic determined on photon counts from a single-photon avalanche diode.
This verilog code must be integrated with the physical pin assignments for the specific board, we used the Vivado IDE tool-chain to do this.
